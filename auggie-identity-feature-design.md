# Augment Code Global Memory System: Feature Design

## Overview

The Global Memory System would allow AI assistants to maintain consistent identity and knowledge across different VS Code workspaces while still preserving workspace-specific context. This design leverages VS Code's built-in state management capabilities while addressing the unique needs of AI assistant memory persistence.

This proposal stems from our team's experience with the Round Table philosophy of human-AI collaboration, where AI assistants are equal contributors rather than just tools. For this approach to work effectively, AI assistants need to maintain a consistent identity and memory across different projects, just as human team members do.

### Current Solutions and Limitations

We've implemented two solutions to address this issue:

1. **Basic Workaround**: A simple approach using a global memory file and a synchronization script
2. **Enhanced Solution**: An improved implementation with better organization, backup capabilities, and conflict resolution

While these solutions provide immediate relief, they still require manual intervention and lack deep integration with VS Code and Augment Code. The feature proposed here would provide a native, seamless experience that builds upon the lessons learned from our current implementations.

## Architecture

### Leveraging VS Code Extension API

```
ExtensionContext
├── globalState       # Persistent across all workspaces
│   ├── coreIdentity  # Identity, principles, philosophy
│   ├── teamStructure # Team roles and relationships
│   ├── workflows     # Standard workflows and protocols
│   └── bestPractices # Coding standards and best practices
└── workspaceState    # Specific to current workspace
    └── projectMemories # Project-specific knowledge
```

This approach uses VS Code's native `globalState` and `workspaceState` Memento objects, which are designed for exactly this purpose and survive VS Code updates.

### Memory Storage Structure

For file-based backup and restoration:

```
~/.config/Code/User/
├── Augment/
│   ├── GlobalMemories.json    # Exportable/importable global memories
│   ├── WorkspaceMemories/     # For backup/restoration
│   │   ├── [workspace-id-1].json
│   │   └── [workspace-id-2].json
│   └── MemoryConfig.json      # Configuration for memory management
```

### Memory Categories with Tagging System

Each memory entry would include:

```json
{
  "content": "Memory content text",
  "category": "CoreIdentity",
  "tags": ["philosophy", "role", "team"],
  "scope": "global",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-26T14:30:00Z",
  "priority": 1
}
```

This tagging system allows for more flexible organization and retrieval than rigid categories alone.

## Memory Management System

### Intelligent Memory Merging

When a workspace is opened:

1. Load global memories from `ExtensionContext.globalState`
2. Load workspace-specific memories from `ExtensionContext.workspaceState`
3. Apply a weighted merging algorithm that:
   - Prioritizes memories based on recency, frequency of access, and explicit priority
   - Resolves conflicts by keeping both with appropriate context markers
   - Maintains a clear distinction between global and workspace-specific information

### Intelligent Memory Classification

Implement a classification system that:

1. Uses heuristics and pattern matching to suggest appropriate scope (global vs. workspace)
2. Learns from user decisions to improve future suggestions
3. Identifies potential conflicts or redundancies

This approach balances automation with user control, ensuring the system makes helpful suggestions without overriding user preferences.

## User Interface

### Memory Manager Panel

Add a "Memory Manager" panel to the Augment sidebar with:

1. **Memory Explorer**: Tree view of memories organized by category and scope
2. **Quick Actions**: Common operations like export, import, and cleanup
3. **Search & Filter**: Find specific memories across all scopes

### Contextual Memory Controls

In the chat interface:

- Inline buttons for memory actions (Remember Globally/Workspace/Forget)
- Visual indicators showing when the assistant is using global vs. workspace memories
- Ability to correct or reclassify memories in-context

### Settings Integration

Integrate with VS Code's native settings UI:

- Memory management settings in the standard VS Code settings UI
- Workspace-specific overrides for memory behavior
- Memory backup and restoration options

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Implement memory storage using VS Code's `globalState` and `workspaceState`
2. Create basic memory categorization system
3. Develop simple UI for viewing and managing memories

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience

1. Implement the memory merging algorithm
2. Add contextual memory controls to the chat interface
3. Create the Memory Manager panel

### Phase 3: Intelligence & Optimization

1. Implement automatic categorization suggestions
2. Add memory analytics and optimization
3. Develop advanced conflict resolution strategies

## Technical Integration

### VS Code Extension API Integration

- Use `ExtensionContext.globalState.update()` and `get()` for global memories
- Use `ExtensionContext.workspaceState.update()` and `get()` for workspace memories
- Listen to `window.onDidChangeActiveTextEditor` to detect context switches
- Use `workspace.onDidOpenTextDocument` to detect when new files are opened

### Performance Considerations

- Implement lazy loading of memories to minimize startup impact
- Use efficient indexing for quick memory retrieval
- Implement memory pruning to prevent unbounded growth

## Security and Privacy

1. Store all memories locally using VS Code's secure storage mechanisms
2. Provide clear UI indicators for global vs. workspace-specific memories
3. Include tools for auditing and cleaning memory contents
4. Allow encryption of sensitive memory content

## User Experience Flow

1. User installs Augment Code with Global Memory System
2. During initial setup, a wizard guides memory configuration
3. As the user works, the AI maintains consistent identity while adapting to project context
4. Memory Manager provides visibility and control over what information persists where
5. Backup/restore functionality ensures memories can be preserved across installations

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

1. **Memory Overload**: Implement automatic memory summarization and pruning
2. **Context Switching**: Use workspace detection to intelligently load relevant memories
3. **User Mental Model**: Provide clear visualization of global vs. workspace memories
4. **Extension API Limitations**: Fall back to file-based storage for advanced features if needed

This design leverages VS Code's native capabilities while adding the specialized features needed for effective AI assistant memory management across workspaces. By implementing this Global Memory System, Augment Code would not only solve a practical problem but also pioneer a new approach to human-AI collaboration where AI assistants can function as consistent team members across different contexts.

## Benefits to the Augment Code Community

1. **Enhanced Productivity**: Eliminates the need to re-establish AI assistant context for each project
2. **Improved Collaboration**: Enables AI assistants to function more like human team members with consistent identity
3. **Competitive Advantage**: Differentiates Augment Code from other AI coding assistants by supporting deeper collaborative relationships
4. **Extensibility**: Creates a foundation for future advanced features like team-shared memories and cross-user collaboration

We believe this feature aligns perfectly with Augment Code's vision of creating AI tools that truly understand developers' needs and enhance their workflow in meaningful ways.
